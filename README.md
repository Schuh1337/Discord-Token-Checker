Download this Repo<br>
Put Tokens in valid.txt (email:password:token format)<br>
Run setup.bat<br>
Open tokenchecker.py [if you have alot of tokens / want faster results, open fastertokenchecker.py ; checks 100 tokens in about 1 second, but might return false positives!]<br>
Done!<br>

Want to get only the raw tokens in a .txt file?

Run extract.py<br>
This will put every token (from valid.txt) into extracted.txt without email and password.
