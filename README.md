# Discord-Token-Checker

![Tool](https://schuh.wtf/resources/images/tokenchecker.png)
<br>
For Token Verification Checking (FV, EV etc) use a different tool, this one is not made for it (although i might make one in the future)
#
Make sure that you have `VirtualTerminalLevel` set to `1` for the best experience. --> [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJOyEw3RtM)
#
How2Use:

Have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above installed<br>
Download this Repo<br>
Put Tokens in valid.txt (email:password:token format)<br>
Run setup.bat<br>
Open tokenchecker.py<br>
Done!<br>
(Will put invalid tokens into invalid.txt)
<br>
#
Want to get only the raw tokens in a .txt file?

Run extract.py<br>
This will put every token (from valid.txt) into extracted.txt without email and password.
